<h2>Success Evaluation</h2>
<p>The purpose of creating a site for CossiePlay is to increase their amount of weekly and overall clients whilst also increasing market awareness and publicity. Success will be evaluated by comparing the amount of costumes being ordered per week, amount of people attending parties and amount of hits on the website could also contribute a small amount. Although it could be argued that not everyone who is into cosplay would like to attend the parties, the parties can still be used as an evaluation to see if the publicity of Cossieplay is increasing. As for the age demographic being targeted. evaluation is simple; if more high school students and younger adults order costumes then the site is successful. The increase in sale of second-hand costumes can also be measured as a sign of increase in amount of clients.</p>
<h2>Target Audience</h2>
<p>The current target age demographic of CossiePlay is 35-50. The clients have expressed that they would like this site to appeal to a younder audience such as high school students and young adults.</p>
